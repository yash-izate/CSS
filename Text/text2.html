    <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>
    <p>Tony Stark, the man behind the Iron Man armor, is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe. Born as the son
        of wealthy industrialist Howard Stark, Tony inherited his father's company, Stark Industries, and became a
        brilliant inventor and businessman. At the age of 21, Tony was already a tech prodigy, revolutionizing weapons
        technology.

        His life took a dramatic turn when he was captured by terrorists while demonstrating a new missile overseas.
        Gravely injured and forced to build a weapon for his captors, Tony instead created a suit of powered armor to
        escape. The suit not only saved his life by keeping shrapnel away from his heart but also became the prototype
        for his future Iron Man armor.

        After escaping captivity, Tony vowed to use his genius and resources to protect the world as Iron Man. He became
        a founding member of the Avengers, using his technological prowess to fight against global threats. Despite his
        confident and charismatic public persona, Tony battles inner demons, including struggles with alcoholism and the
        moral implications of his inventions.</p>
